# My-TinyApp

This is the project for the second week of Lighthouse Labs.

Project Description:

This three-day project had us building a tiny web app using Node. The app allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, easier to remember, URLs.

I've built the HTTP Server to handle requests from the browser (client).

I got introduced to some more advanced JavaScript and node concepts and also learn more about Express, a mini web framework.
